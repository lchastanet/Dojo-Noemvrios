First you need to install dev dependencies :

```shell
npm i
```

then to test your code :

```shell
npm run test:[name of the kata]
```

#

You should complete katas like this :

1. string-compare
2. chessboard
3. soccer
4. pascal-case
5. uniq

#

Tips : to work properly, your function/class must have the same name as the export.
